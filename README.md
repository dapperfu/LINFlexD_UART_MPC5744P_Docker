# Usage:

## Example Description

- Lets do some basic math.

# Why DevOps?

> - Smaller code changes are simpler (more atomic) and have fewer unintended consequences.
> - Fault isolation is simpler and quicker.
> - Mean time to resolution (MTTR) is shorter because of the smaller code changes and quicker fault isolation.
> - Testability improves due to smaller, specific changes. These smaller changes allow more accurate positive and negative tests.
> - Elapsed time to detect and correct production escapes is shorter with a faster rate of release.
> - The backlog of non-critical defects is lower because defects are often fixed before other feature pressures arise.
> - The product improves rapidly through fast feature introduction and fast turn-around on feature changes.
> - Upgrades introduce smaller units of change and are less disruptive.
> - CI-CD product feature velocity is high. The high velocity improves the time spent investigating and patching defects.
